Multiple unit rates may exist that correspond to varying volumes of usage i.e. a ‘block’ or ‘step’ tariff (first 50kWh @ X cents, next 50kWh at Y cents etc.</li><li>**SINGLE_RATE_CONT_LOAD** - as above, but with an additional, separate unit rate charged for all energy usage from a controlled load i.e. separately metered appliance like hot water service, pool pump etc.</li><li>**TIME_OF_USE** - energy usage is charged at unit rates that vary dependent on time of day and day of week that the energy is consumed</li><li>**TIME_OF_USE_CONT_LOAD** - as above, but with an additional, separate unit rate charged for all energy usage from a controlled load i.e. separately metered appliance like hot water service, pool pump etc.</li><li>**FLEXIBLE** - energy usage is charged at unit rates that vary based on external factors</li><li>**FLEXIBLE_CONT_LOAD** - as above, but with an additional, separate unit rate charged for all energy usage from a controlled load i.e. separately metered appliance like hot water service, pool pump etc.</li><li>**QUOTA** - all energy usage is charged at a single fixed rate, up to a specified usage quota/allowance. All excess usage beyond the allowance is then charged at a single unit rate (may not be the best way to explain it but it is essentially a ‘subscription’ or telco style product i.e. $50/month for up to 150kWh included usage</li></ul>",
